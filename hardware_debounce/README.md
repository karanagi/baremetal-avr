# Debounce

~~This directory contains an example of debouncing a switch using the circuit found [here](<https://avr8.com/switch-debounce-guide/>). Without a Schmitt trigger it seems to result in errors occasionally, but it seems good enough when accuracy is no the top priority.~~

## Update 2025-11-27

I have decided to try a proper debounce solution with a low-pass filter and schmitt trigger. I have referenced [this video](<https://inv.nadeko.net/watch?v=EPSCd9rApUU>) to learn how to designing a filter.
