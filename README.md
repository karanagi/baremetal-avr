# Bare Metal AVR Playground

This repo contains a collection of projects I have written to learn bare metal programming on AVR Microcontrollers. 

The `Makefile` contained in these projects and the default project template has been borrowed from [this project]("<https://github.com/m3y54m/start-avr>")
